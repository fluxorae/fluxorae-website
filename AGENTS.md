# AGENTS instructions for d:\Fluxorae

Provide a complete, ultra-detailed marketing structure for Fluxorae’s public site so that future contributors and automation agents can keep every section consistent, purposeful, and traceable. The following outline clarifies the intent of each page, the essential modules, and the expected storytelling flow.

## General style and behavior
- Tone: confident, consultative, outcome-oriented, and enterprise-safe.
- Messaging: focus on measurable business impact (ROI, accuracy, cost reduction) and Fluxorae’s unique combination of consulting, proprietary engineering, and AI-ready operational rigor.
- CTAs: every major page ends in a conversion-focused CTA (typically “Book a Call,” “Request Proposal,” or “Schedule a Consultation”) plus a supporting secondary CTA that encourages exploration (e.g., “Explore Solutions,” “View Case Studies,” “Download Pricing Guide”).
- Visual system: prioritize data-backed visuals (metrics, dashboards, stack diagrams) and logos/certifications for trust.
- Accessibility: ensure semantic headings, keyboard focus states, and responsive layouts.
- Navigation: top nav mirrors the sitemap below; global footer reiterates the legal, trust, and contact links.
